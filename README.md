## What is BandChain?

BandChain is a **cross-chain data oracle platform** that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. It is designed to be **compatible with most smart contract and blockchain development frameworks**. It does the heavy lifting jobs of pulling data from external sources, aggregating them, and packaging them into the format that’s easy to use and verifiable efficiently across multiple blockchains.

Band's flexible oracle design allows developers to **query any data** including real-world events, sports, weather, random numbers and more. Developers can create custom-made oracles using WebAssembly to connect smart contracts with traditional web APIs within minutes.

## Installation

Please refer to [this documentation](https://docs.bandchain.org/node-validators/run-node/joining-mainnet/installation) for the most up-to-date installation guide.
